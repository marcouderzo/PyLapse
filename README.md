# PyLapse


A Python Script for Timelapse Feature for Photoshop CC 2017.

## What is it

Drawing apps like Procreate have built-in functionalities to watch the timelapse of an artpiece, from start to finish. Well, Adobe Photoshop doesn't have this feature at all. 
The goal is to create an external script that can interact with Photoshop to do that.
